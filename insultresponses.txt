I fart in your general direction, not great sir.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries. Move along now.
What sad times are these when passing ruffians can insult Holy Knights at will.
I wouldn't want such a pediculous rakefire like you in my household.
You are nothing but a fopdoodle and a gobermouth.
You're just a whiffle-whaffle. Shut your potty mouth.
Go eat some more thorn-apples you twat.
