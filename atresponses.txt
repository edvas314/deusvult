What do you want from me? I'm not in a mood to speak with pesants.
Stop your nonsense, can't you see we have a Crused on our hands?
If you want to join the Holly March, pick up a weapon, not words with me!
Stop bothering me and fight for the Holy Land!
Your mother is a hamster and your father smells of elderberries. Move along now.
